          long_synopsis: "Leering punters, seedy dives, cruel and crude objectification of women's bodies... the classic image of a strip joint does not leave much space for the notion that occasionally the women might enjoy the performances they give. However, a new ethnography of a lap dancing club in the North of England presents a slightly more complicated picture of life as a sexual entertainer. The sociologist Rachela Colosi worked as a dancer in the clubs she studied and her study offers a rare insiders account of the relationships between the dancers, with the management and the highs and lows, rewards and occasional despair of life as a stripper.\x0aAlso, Laurie Taylor will be talking to Marek Kohn about his predictions for the shape of British society in 2100 after global warming has brought its influence to bear.\x0aProducer: Charlie Taylor."

So what has he missed out on?  Does the fame of being a senior government minister compare in any way with that of being in a successful band.\x0a\x0aIn this series he meets five people who tasted the fame he craved. Each of the warm and engaging interviews reveal something different about life in music and the truth behind the myths.\x0a\x0aIn Episode two Alan meets Chris Spedding - a guitarist who has played with many of the biggest names in rock but who, except for one top ten hit, has nearly always managed to avoid the limelight himself.  He was on Top of The Pops - but sometimes hidden inside a Womble outfit. Alan and Chris discuss what the rock and roll life is like when you're not that famous."

          long_synopsis: "Lauren, Jonathan, Mohsin, Caroline, Fiona and Samantha are six graduates from Leeds University and Leeds Metropolitan University who completed their degrees in June last year. They had studied hard and paid their fees, and were ready to begin the search for that elusive first job. But, along with over 300,000 other graduate hopefuls, they were joining the job market in the midst of a recession and when the number of students going to university was at the highest it had ever been. \x0a\x0aSo, to see just how hard the year ahead would be, the graduates agreed to be followed.\x0a\x0aFrom handing out CVs, applying for work experience and signing on, to returning home, dealing with rejection and, in some cases, finding work, Sarfraz Manzoor pieces their year together. \x0a\x0aThe first programme follows the group in their first six months as graduates. \x0a\x0aLike their peers, our graduates believed that a degree would be an investment for their futures, with higher salaries and rapid career progression being the expected returns. But will their much-coveted degree certificate be a stepping stone to a job, or is it time for them to revaluate this traditional narrative, and reconsider why they went to university in the first place?\x0a\x0aSarfraz Manzoor offers insights into the graduate labour market. He hears how important graduates are for the growth of specialist markets in the UK - but are they up to the task? One company reveals that out of 2000 applications, they were unable to find 20 suitable candidates.\x0a\x0aCombining first-hand testimony with wider analysis, Sarfraz explores the genuine experience of today's graduate, the impact they have on the economy and society, and what their futures may hold.\x0a\x0aProducer: Katie Burningham\x0aA Falling Tree production."

          medium_synopsis: "Comedy writer and historian Glenn Mitchell examines exclusive and lesser-known recordings of Peter Sellers, and reveals a lighter side to the life of one Britain's comic legends."
          long_synopsis: "Comedy writer and historian Glenn Mitchell examines exclusive and lesser known recordings of Peter Sellers and reveals a fascinating wealth of recently discovered recordings presenting a new insight into the life of this comic legend.  \x0a\x0aAfter Peter Sellers died thirty years ago in July 1980, the initial rush of glowing eulogies swiftly made way for often highly condemnatory accounts of his personality and behaviour. Some of these are, admittedly, accurate, others take incidents in isolation without regard for the context of the events described, while in some instances the claims rely on inaccuracies and misassumptions. \x0a\x0aFortunately there has been more perspective among recent chronicles but the trend has continued to portray Sellers's personal life as one with few, if any, redeeming features.\x0a\x0aAs regards his work, many accounts have concentrated on the obvious aspects - the Panther films, Dr. Strangelove, perhaps also The Goon Show, but Peter Sellers left far more than that. \x0a\x0aMitchell, the writer and presenter of this programme, was only 21 when the actor died but has been collecting Sellers material from an early age. In this personal take on the subject, Mitchell chronicles Sellers' career in parallel with his own lifelong interest in the actor's work. He will examine various recordings, explaining in each instance its place within the canon, and how it may have shaped - or been shaped by - Sellers' life and career. \x0a\x0aThe programme also explores the softer, compassionate side to the legendary actor's nature, the aspect of the man which once led to him talking a complete stranger - who was perched on a high bridge - out of committing suicide. \x0a\x0aAmong the recent finds is a personal recording Sellers made for a television producer whose daughter lost her sight. The never before broadcast recording includes readings of the poet William McGonagall with various comments throughout. Not only is it vintage Sellers but it reveals a remarkable and malleable side to his personality, catching him at a very relaxed moment in his life contrasting with his often cited volatile nature. \x0a\x0aMitchell's own focus will be on the lesser-known Sellers material he has amassed, including home-movie prints, soundtracks, rare interviews and out-takes. The programme also profiles written archives from his first BBC TV and Radio auditions.\x0a\x0aUltimately Sellers in the Attic will tell his remarkable story - on the 30th anniversary of his death - by revisiting the less obvious items from his vast legacy, including such gems from the BBC archives as his 1970 performance of the macabre music-hall monologue The Ballad of Sam Hall, recorded at Wilton's in East London."

          long_synopsis: "Mark Whitaker focuses on a new sort of panic that swept the nation at the very end of the 19th century - a panic about the number of 'habitual drunkards' in the country and the impact they were having. \x0a\x0aThis was the time of pioneering social research by the likes of Booth and Rowntree, and also of a new belief in the ability of government to intervene to change social conditions. Allied to this was a growing medical confidence that addiction to alcohol was a disease that could be isolated and treated - and a new term was invented, 'inebriety'. \x0a\x0aPublic and political opinion on the matter was hugely influenced by the publication by the Daily Telegraph in 1891 of a long series of letters giving first-hand accounts of alcohol addiction. They were revelatory, and the paper called them a \"sad mirror of the National Sin\". There was particular concern over the extent of female drunkenness, and this fed into fears about a deterioration of the 'national stock'. \x0a\x0aA leading medical figure argued that \"the wide-spread prevalence of alcoholism among women, especially during the reproductive period of life, is one of the important factors making for racial decay\". \x0a\x0aSuch fears came to a head when many young men proved insufficiently healthy to fight in the Boer War. In 1898 Parliament passed an Inebriates Act that required local authorities to set up special 'reformatories' as an alternative to prison for those arrested time after time for being drunk and disorderly. Courts could sentence people to them for up to three years. The shift was from condemnation to cure: but the reformatories couldn't survive after the outbreak if war in 1914.\x0a\x0aProducer: Mark Whitaker\x0aA Square Dog production for BBC Radio 4."

Sheila explores the changing fortunes of different berries, finds out how producers compete with cheap foreign imports and hears about some new varieties that will soon be available.\x0a\x0aProduced by Margaret Collins."

          long_synopsis: "It was after Germany's invasion of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union in 1941 that Hitler's attention was first drawn to the potential for Muslim recruits to swell his ranks. For the many thousands of captured Soviet Muslims, the opportunity to serve in the Wehrmacht offered an escape from the brutality and starvation of the prison camps. Elsewhere, a major recruitment drive amongst Bosnian Muslims led to tens of thousands signing up for the Waffen-SS. Formed into exclusive Muslim units, these men fought in some of the most brutal campaigns of the entire war.\x0a\x0aThis programme investigates why Hitler and Himmler apparently cast aside their Nazi ideal of an Aryan master race, justifying the admission of Islam into their ranks. It asks what attracted these men to fight for the Third Reich, how they were treated by their German officers and how they conducted themselves in the bedlam of war. Were they hopeless soldiers who committed unspeakable atrocities; or did they fight bravely for the Fuhrer? \x0a\x0aWe examine the fate of these Muslims at the end of the war. With Hitler dead and the Third Reich defeated there was nothing to protect them, and most were killed as traitors.\x0a\x0aPresented by Julian O'Halloran.\x0a\x0aProducer: Jennifer Chryss\x0aA Juniper production for BBC Radio 4."

          long_synopsis: "Puerto Rico is a strange place. An island and a commonwealth, it exists in an uneasy relationship with its massive neighbour, the US. All of its political powers, and much of its government cash, come from Washington, but Puerto Ricans can't vote in US federal elections. And now an economic crisis generated in the US has come home to roost on the island. Puerto Rico's Republican governor has announced a wave of layoffs of public sector workers, along with deep cuts in services. Students responded by staging the longest ever university strike in North American history. And this dispute plays into the bitter arguments over the island's status. Should it seek independence, and the right to make its own decisions? Or should it push for more integration into the US, so at least it has some say in its future?\x0a\x0aMaria Hinojosa, the distinguished journalist and presenter of Latino USA, travels to the island to examine its future through the voices of young people. She meets the students who so furiously defied the governor. She hears from young activists who are pushing for independence. And she seeks out one of the many young Puerto Ricans who are signing up to serve in the US military - and who see their primary loyalty on the mainland."

          long_synopsis: "Poet, journalist and dancer, Tishani Doshi, has a Welsh mother and a Gujurati father. This twin inheritance is at the heart of her comic, lyrical and tenderly written first novel about four generations of the Patel-Joneses, who live in a little house with orange and black gates next door to the Punjab Women's Association in Madras. It's an epic story full of vividly drawn characters, whose private lives are played out against the backdrop of the public events of the twentieth century, as the family wrestles with what it means to call somewhere home. \x0a\x0aThis first episode begins in August 1968 when Babo, eldest son of Prem Kumar, becomes the first member of the Patel family to leave Madras and fly to London to further his education. On the night before the flight his father has a terrible premonition of trouble, in the form of a dream in which all his family is lost. Babo's mother, meanwhile, has more practical worries on her mind and gives strict instructions to her son about his obligations as a vegan and a follower of the Jain religion. Babo must resist the temptations of meat, alcohol and, most importantly, women. \x0a\x0aHow shocked his parents would be, then, to see their son, four months later, drinking Peppermint Schnapps, eating poached eggs and making love to Sian Jones, a cream-skinned girl from Wales, with whom Babo falls head over heels in love with, from the moment he sees the twirl of red ribbon in her hair. \x0a\x0aThe reader is Indira Varma, who appeared recently in the 6 part BBC drama Luther. Indira's previous television and film roles include Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love in 1997, and Bride and Prejudice in 2004. In 2006 she played Suzie Costello in Torchwood.\x0a\x0aAbridged and Directed by Nigel Lewis\x0a\x0aProduced by Kate McAll."

It looks good this year for Puffins, Kittiwakes and Shags - but remains dire for Fulmars. Although we won't be able to give you the whole picture until the Biologists have crunched their data later in the autumn, we do have an interview with Francis Daunt and the wonderful pictures brought back by shags wearing cameras. How can pictures taken by seabirds help bioloists understand the ocean. We'll find out.\x0a\x0aWe'll be on the Somerset Levels trying to spot the Little Bittern, a rare heron, its very presence a monument we're told to the success of landscape conservation.\x0a\x0aAnd to Dubai where Miles Barton from the Natural History Unit reports from the desert and the efforts to save species such as the Spiny Lizard, or Dub!\x0a\x0aThere will be other stories too from around the world with Kelvin Boot giving us an update on wildlife making the news - he'll be live in the studio.\x0a\x0aPresented by Brett Westwood\x0aProduced by Kirsty Henderson\x0aSeries Editor Julian Hector."

The composer suffered an extreme creative block following the catastrophic premiere of his first symphony. After three years of silence, a hypnotherapist, Dr. Dahl, effected a cure and rescued his career. Prof. Winston also investigates evidence that a medical condition was responsible for Rachmaninoff's famously large hand-span, with pianist Peter Donohoe demonstrating the difficulty this presents for would-be performers of his music.\x0a\x0aProducer: Chris Taylor."

          long_synopsis: "\"Drink is doing us more damage in the War than all the German submarines put together\", insisted Lloyd George in February 1915. \x0a\x0aContinuing his history series on how British governments have approached the 'Drink Question', Mark Whitaker looks at the years of the First World War, when everything was determined by the needs of  'national efficiency'. \x0a\x0aAfter a few months of war it became clear that Britain needed to make more munitions - and fast. But output was slowed down by the workers' drinking habits. \"We are fighting German, Austrians and Drink\", said Lloyd George as he embarked on a plan for the government to buy up the country's whole liquor trade. \x0a\x0aBut the Cabinet balked at the price. Instead a Central Control Board (CCB) was set up in 1915 with the power to take over the trade in areas of particular sensitivity to the war effort. The largest of these was Gretna-Carlisle, where a new national munitions factory was built. \x0a\x0aThe number of licences was drastically reduced: the beer was weakened: the sale of spirits limited: and pubs encouraged to provide food as well as drink. Newspapers called it \"the largest social experiment of our time\". A Carlisle vicar called state control \"the dawning of a new era\". It worked too. Convictions for drunkenness in CCB-controlled areas declined dramatically, and many began to think that nationalisation might finally be the solution to the 'Drink Question'.\x0a\x0aProducer: Mark Whitaker\x0aA Square Dog production for BBC Radio 4."

The system was reformed three years ago - but have the changes worked?\x0a\x0aThere have been allegations the system is slow, bureaucratic and open to abuse. In some cases lawyers are appointed to oversee people's financial arrangements - and families claim they charge excessive fees. In other cases, it's a relative who's appointed as a deputy - but are there adequate safeguards to ensure they're not misappropriating the money? Fran Abrams investigates cases where the system has left some vulnerable people worse off.\x0a\x0aProducer: Samantha Fenwick."

          long_synopsis: "This week Libby Purves is joined by Dan Edelstyn, Linda Marlowe, Kurt Jackson and Gregg Wallace.\x0a\x0aDan Edelstyn is a filmmaker whose discovery of his grandmother's diaries leads him to uncover his family's long-lost vodka factory in the Ukraine. He attempts to revive the brand, 'Zorokovich 1917' and bring prosperity back to his great-grandparents' village by entering the cut-throat world of international business. The 24-part series of short films How to Re-Estabish a Vodka Empire can be seen on website Babelgum and next year on More4.\x0a\x0aLinda Marlowe is an actress and performer best known for her collaboration with Steven Berkoff and for shows including 'Oh! Calcutta!', 'Berkoff's Women' and 'The World's Wife'. Her latest show is 'My Hamlet' which she is performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It consists of Linda, Shakespeare's greatest text and six brilliant puppeteers from Fingers Theatre, Georgia. She plays Sarah, a cleaner who finds herself playing the actor's definitive role, as a company of puppets come to life around her.\x0a\x0aKurt Jackson is a landscape painter and environmentalist. He has been the resident artist for the Glastonbury Festival for the past twenty years and was the Greenpeace artist on the Rainbow Warrior. He has a new exhibition, 'The Dart' in the autumn at the Lemon Street Gallery, Truro which will show paintings and sculptures created on a journey along the river Dart in Devon, inspired by the stories his father told him about his childhood there during the war. A book Kurt Jackson - A New Genre of Landscape Painting is published by Lund Humphries. \x0a\x0aGregg Wallace has been in the food business all of his working life, starting off in Convent Garden selling fruit and veg. He is probably best known as co-presenter of BBC One's highly successful 'Master Chef' and 'Celebrity Masterchef'. As a self confessed pudding addict he has compiled a book of desserts called 'Gregg's favourite puddings' which is published by Octopus Books."

          long_synopsis: "There are still few black leaders in British political life - but life-long trade unionist Bill Morris finds that as far back as the London of 1848 the son of slave was leading one of this countries most powerful political movements.\x0a\x0aFew of us have heard of William Cuffay, a physically deformed tailor who lived in Soho.  And yet he was notorious in his day, to the extent that the political class of the 1840s dubbed him \"the pore old blackymore rogue\" as he went on to lead a political movement so powerful that Britain cowered behind its shuttered windows and the massed ranks of its armies.\x0a\x0aJust as the thrones of Europe were yet again tumbling to revolution, the 1848 Chartist uprising in favour of democracy and equality in London threatened the status quo in Britain.  History records that an articulate democrat, William Cuffay, emerged as a key organiser of the mass demonstration that faced the Duke of Wellington's army in the demand for the vote.  Revolution threatened the capital - but who was the diminutive tailor holding such sway?  \x0a\x0aLord Morris follows a predecessor in the labour movement through his fascinating story - from son of a St Kitts slave to political leader, and ultimately into exile at Her Majesty's pleasure in Tasmania.\x0a\x0aProducer: Philip Sellars."

          short_synopsis: "Mark Whitaker explores the 'improved pub' movement of the 1920s."
          medium_synopsis: "Mark Whitaker's series on the politics of alcohol reaches the 1920s. With consumption falling, and nationalisation threatened, the drinks industry invested in 'improved pubs'."
          long_synopsis: "It seemed possible during the 1920s that the 'Drink Question' that had bedevilled British governments for so long might finally be about to be consigned to the past. \x0a\x0aThe fall in consumption - which had started during the First World War - continued throughout the decade, and political attention focused on why. This was when the Labour Party formed its first governments, and there were powerful socialist voices arguing for a full nationalisation of the drinks industry. This could be a route to weaning the working classes away from a product that was \"a powerful weapon in the hands of the exploiters\". George Bernard Shaw called liquor \"a chloroform that allows the poor to endure the painful operation of living\".  \x0a\x0aBut while governments chose to sit on the fence during the 1920s, the brewing industry got busy. Led by people like Ernest Nevile, the head of Whitbread's, they set about designing and building a new type of pub - one that would attract a new middle class clientele. \"The presence in public houses of people who will not tolerate insobriety makes excess unfashionable\". \x0a\x0aWhat were called 'improved pubs' - huge buildings with bars, restaurants, ball rooms, bowling greens and even tennis courts - sprung up in the new suburbs. When Nevile said \"if I can cure drunkenness in the country in my time, that will satisfy me\" he was talking business, not morality. \x0a\x0aThe programme also looks at the first attempts at a sociology of the pub, and what people wanted from it.\x0a\x0aProducer: Mark Whitaker\x0aA Square Dog production for BBC Radio 4."

Like products on a supermarket shelf, our jobs, our relationships, our bodies and our identities are all there for the choosing. We are encouraged to 'be ourselves', but the pressure to make those choices can lead to enormous anxiety. In a new study Renata Selacl researches dating sites, self help books and people's relationship to celebrity, and uncovers the complexities involved in the choices we make and how they often lead to disquiet. In Thinking Allowed on 28 July, Laurie Taylor explores whether we have too much choice in our lives.\x0aAlso, a new study from Norwegian Sociologist Sveinung Sandberg looks at the life skills that Oslo drug dealers acquire and explores whether operating from within a welfare state is very different from the street life of dealers in the USA.\x0a\x0a\x0aProducer: Charlie Taylor."

Now that the neurologist no longer has a two and a half hour drive each way from Swansea to Aberystwyth he can run clinics for his patients in mid Wales every six weeks rather than every three months. Instead the neurologist, Dr Hinds, links up to the consulting room in Bronglais Hospital in Aberystwyth from his home base in Morriston Hospital in Swansea. With the latest technology he can see the patients and any scans and blood test results. \x0a\x0aIn Gloucestershire patients with conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder who need daily monitoring are using technology to take readings of blood pressure and lung function in their homes. These measurements are sent to their GPs' computers. \x0a\x0aIn Scotland, too, telemedicine is bringing patients in remote areas specialist advice and treament. Mark Porter reports on these projects and asks how far can telemedicine go? Do the patients like it?\x0a\x0aProducer: Deborah Cohen."

So why, in British politics, does the deputy so rarely reach the summit? And why, when he does, does it usually end in disaster? Think of Michael Foot or Anthony Eden. These programmes talk to a number of the politicians who became deputy leader of their party or even Deputy Prime Minister but who just didn't reach the summit -- people like Roy Hattersley, Michael Heseltine, Shirley Williams, Margaret Beckett and Geoffrey Howe. Some never really wanted the job in the first place, others found it an exciting experience from which they learned a lot. One likens it to a bucket of warm spit, only worse. So is there a jinx on the role of the deputy? The political commentator, Julia Langdon, finds out in The Curse of the Number Two.\x0a\x0aProducer Chris Bond."

There is one fantastic source, and it is now online: the Old Bailey Archives.\x0a\x0aThrough court cases, we can hear the voices of the 18th century - thanks to the speedy court shorthand writers, everyone's speech is recorded, from the posh to the poor. It's the nearest thing we have to a tape recording of the past.\x0a\x0aProfessor Amanda Vickery presents dramatised extracts from gripping court cases and discusses with fellow historians what they reveal about 18th century society and culture. \x0a\x0aIn this programme, the voices of children. Even children as young as seven appeared in court in the 18th century, as witnesses, victims - and as criminals. Amanda Vickery presents three cases which capture the voices of children, and open up the reality of their lives. \x0a\x0aOne reveals the network of relationships in the workhouse, and the cruelty and kindness which coexisted there. The second exposes the vulnerability of teenagers working as apprentices. And the third features a little girl who is sentenced to death - but who then escapes the gallows and makes a long and prosperous life for herself.\x0a\x0aWith historians Tim Hitchcock, Ruth Richardson and Zoe Laidlaw. Recorded on location in The Foundling Museum."

          medium_synopsis: "Since the 2009 coup in Madagascar, the international community has withdrawn aid and restricted trade. Linda Pressly visits to discover the fallout from the political crisis."
          long_synopsis: "Madagascar is in crisis. Since a coup last year that brought a DJ in his mid-thirties to power as president, this huge island nation has become a pariah state. For the most part, the international community has refused to recognise the new government. Most seriously for Madagascar, in an effort to persuade the new regime to restore democracy, most aid has been withdrawn. This has created a huge dent in the state's coffers because donor assistance accounted for a staggering half of Madagascar's income.\x0a\x0aThe fallout for an already poor nation has been profound. Thousands have lost their jobs in garment factories as a result of the United States' decision to suspend favourable trade tariffs for Madagascar. Others eke out a living on the streets, or have headed for the countryside to subsist on what rice they can grow. Hospitals and schools are under serious pressure. Over half of all children are malnourished, and family breakdown is an everyday event.  \x0a\x0aNow there is evidence that Madagascar's unique and spectacular wildlife - ancient hardwoods, baobabs, and lemurs - is especially endangered by corruption, poverty and a breakdown in the rule of law.  The forests are being plundered.  Loggers have illegally sought out and exported rare rosewood, and there is anecdotal evidence that hunting for bush meat, and the smuggling of rare wildlife are both on the increase.\x0a\x0aAs Madagascar celebrates fifty years of independence from French rule, Linda Pressly visits the capital of Antananorivo and travels out to one of the National Parks to find out how people are surviving in this island nation seemingly in freefall."

Times have changed since a magician produced a startled rabbit out of top hat with a puff of smoke.  Today we expect more, and the modern magician apparently does the impossible before our eyes. But spare a thought for where the trick came from. How did the magic get there? \x0a\x0aPresenter John Sugar does not reveal any trade secrets - like how to saw a woman in half, or the best way to float in the air - but we do hear how the sale of magic has changed, with the impact of the internet and the way conventions are developing new environments for its promotion and sale. The programme also hears about the leading magic shops and studios of 60 years ago, revealing the characters who created the magic.\x0a\x0aToday, magic revolves around the internet and magic conventions. The key gathering is in Blackpool in late February. The programme visits the 58th Magic Convention, attended by 3500 magicians. We speak to the organizers and the performers, and soak up the atmosphere. \x0a\x0aDiscover more about the way magic is brought and sold in this engaging programme which celebrates the innovators, demonstrators, characters and studios who make sure magic continues to touch all our lives."

          long_synopsis: "A number of companies are gearing up to take advantage of the subsidy the government is paying to people who fit solar panels to generate electricity - the Feed in Tariff or FIT. The idea being they fit the panels for free but take the generous tax free revenues that flow from their use for the next twenty five years. It's been calculated that the revenue from FIT could pay for the installation three times over. Think tank, the Policy Exchange, says FIT should be abolished because it is costs nearly £500 to save a tonne of carbon under the scheme and there are more cost effective methods of reducing carbon output. \x0a\x0aTourist authorities in Jersey have complained to the BBC because they say that the Channel Islands weather is frequently ignored or inaccurate in national broadcasts. They say this has an impact on tourist revenues because it is well known that people take impulse breaks based on weather reports.\x0a\x0aLocal authorities have been urged to dip into their pension pots by a local government think tank as a means of combating central government cuts. The New Local Government Initiative say there are millions of pounds in the Local Authority Pensions pot that could be profitably and safely used by town halls battling central government cuts to protect jobs and assets in their areas."

          long_synopsis: "With universities facing swingeing funding cuts, a handful are already officially classified as \"at risk\" and in danger of complete financial collapse. Vince Cable, the Secretary of State with responsibility for Universities has warned that if that does happen - there'll be no Government bail-out. Meanwhile as the cuts bite, courses are being scrapped and jobs are being axed. The University of Cumbria has seen one third of the Board of Governors step down after a report into their effectiveness described them as naive after presiding over an unsustainable annual deficit. At Leeds Metropolitan University a former Vice Chancellor pursued a 'low-charging, high impact' policy offering cut price courses and pouring over £20m into partnership deals with local sports teams. Critics say the policy left it with a deficit approaching £7-million.\x0a\x0aProfessor Simon Lee the former Vice Chancellor emphatically rejects these criticisms and told us that:\x0a- The decisions made whilst he was Vice Chancellor were done with the full support of the Board of Governors and senior managment team \x0a- The 51% share in Leeds Rugby Club bought by the university offered students the opportunity to study there during the day then watch games at night as well as take part in community projects \x0a- The contribution of £14m to the building of the new Headlingley Carnegie Cricket Pavilion offered first class opportunities to students to study and work there\x0a- By offering lower fees than other universities in England applications to Leeds increased dramatically."

It was called \"the first official recognition of alcoholism as an illness which should be the responsibility of doctors\", and was an acknowledgement that drinking was on the increase. This period saw the first specific warnings about teenage drinking.\x0a\x0aBut controversies followed. Several Regional Hospital Boards were reluctant to invest in the new units; research suggested that in-patient treatment was not necessarily the most effective; and the strategy was attacked for being of limited value to those most in need of help - the unemployed meths drinkers of 'Skid Rows' in the major cities. \x0a\x0aThis was when the pioneering psychiatrist Griffith Edwards first proposed his methods for tackling drunkenness as a public health issue, based on its being recognised as a community-wide problem. Edwards contributes to the programme, while actors read documents from the 1960s. \x0a\x0aProducer: Mark Whitaker\x0aA Square Dog production for BBC Radio 4."

There is one fantastic source, and it is now online: the Old Bailey Archives.\x0a\x0aThrough court cases, we can hear the voices of the 18th century - thanks to the speedy court shorthand writers, everyone's speech is recorded, from the posh to the poor.

Even children as young as seven appeared in court in the 18th century, as witnesses, victims - and as criminals. Amanda Vickery presents three cases which capture the voices of children, and open up the reality of their lives. \x0a\x0aOne reveals the network of relationships in the workhouse, and the cruelty and kindness which coexisted there. The second exposes the vulnerability of teenagers working as apprentices. And the third features a little girl who is sentenced to death - but who then escapes the gallows and makes a long and prosperous life for herself.\x0a\x0aWith historians Tim Hitchcock, Ruth Richardson and Zoe Laidlaw.

          long_synopsis: "The sketch show about modern communication continues its fourth series, delving into areas such as cinema etiquette, school reunions, and doctors' advice.\x0a\x0aRecorded in front of a studio audience, the cast is Rachel Atkins, Dominic Coleman, Lewis Macleod, Julie Mayhew, Ingrid Oliver and Ben Willbond, whose collective Radio 4 credits include Ed Reardon's Week, The Maltby Collection, and Electric Ink. \x0a\x0aThe show had an open-door policy, meaning that anyone could send the show sketches. Some 1500 were sent in this way, with every single one being read by a script-editor or producer - with the funniest stuff getting recorded and broadcast. In addition, a small number of the new writers who got material broadcast this way in series three were given one-to-one script-editing notes and feedback from the production team as part of BBC Radio Comedy's commitment to discovering and developing new writing talent. \x0a\x0aThe scripts were edited by award-winning writers James Cary, Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris. James' writing will be familiar to Radio 4 audiences from the his sketch show Concrete Cow to his sitcoms Think The Unthinkable and Hut 33. He also co-writes, with Milton Jones, Another Case of Milton Jones. Jason and Joel have written sketches for Mitchell & Webb on both TV and Radio, The Armstrong & Miller Show, The Peter Serafinowicz Show, and are the best-selling authors of Bollocks to Alton Towers: Uncommonly British Days Out."

          long_synopsis: "Presented by Jenni Murray.\x0a\x0aThe marching season has arrived in Northern Ireland and a recent Orange Order parade through Ardoyne in north Belfast provoked three nights of rioting. The police came under attack from children as young as eight which prompted Father Gary Donegan, the local parish priest to describe the violence as \"a Disney theme park for rioting children.\" Local politicians say that a new wave of republican terrorism is threatening Northern Ireland with dissident groups recruiting youths who have seen no benefit from the peace process. Father Gary Donegan and Baroness Nuala O'Loan, Northern Ireland's first Police Ombudsman, discuss why children in Belfast are engaging in violence.\x0a\x0aAre we in danger of becoming a nation entirely without backbone? Deportment teacher Jo Kuszmar certainly believes so because she says she has witnessed far too much shambling and slouching on the British high street. She explains why good posture is important and claims that if we stood and moved properly, we'd be less tired, more popular and look slimmer.\x0a\x0aAs a parent, do you look forward to the return of those quiet holidays for two? A summer break that actually involves a 'break' from your grown-up offspring? Well, if you do, then you might have to put those plans on hold for a few years because, according to a recent survey, almost a quarter of all 16 to 25 year olds say that they are likely to go on holiday with their parents in the future. So, how do you plan - and survive - a family holiday with your adult children? How do you please everyone and who pays? Jenni is joined by Carmel Stewart [who believes that holidays are much more enjoyable without your offspring] and Sherry Ashworth [and her grown-up daughter Rachel] who love going on holiday together."

          long_synopsis: "In August 1990 Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait. Kirsty Norman was working for the Museum of Islamic Art, and due to fly out on the day of the invasion. Then tanks started rolling past her apartment, but it was a quiet invasion: The gardener out watering the palm trees as they passed. Two weeks later she was taken hostage, bringing her family history full circle as her father and grandparents had been interned by the Japanese.  \x0a\x0a20 years after those momentous events, Kirsty recounts the story of what happened to her, in two moving programmes based on her diaries and recollections.\x0a\x0aShe tried to escape across the desert but was caught and put in an Iraqi internment camp. For the first time, Kirsty understood the position of being a refugee - displaced, and completely without security. \x0a\x0aReleased a month later, she came back very shaken, and very angry: The guilt of leaving the men behind, and anger at the way the British Embassy in Kuwait and the Foreign Office in London were handling the situation, which might now endanger their lives. \x0a\x0aThe events of August 1990 still vividly etched on her memory, she returns to Kuwait to find out how friends and colleagues there dealt with the events that tore their lives apart so suddenly. And we find out what happened to the Islamic Art collection she was working with. \x0a\x0aProducer: Ruth Evans\x0aA Ruth Evans production for Radio 4."

She tackles him about the photo of Jamie's teacher Jackie. He doesn't think it's that bad. Sure, she's had a few too many, but it's not like she's not decent. At Kathy's insistence, he duly takes the photo off the website. But he refuses to ring Jackie to tell her about the photo. He'd rather let sleeping dogs lie. Infuriated Kathy says she'll ring Jackie herself."

          medium_synopsis: "Mark Whitaker talks to Britain's leading historians about the politics of alcohol, asking them how the past can inform present policy."
          long_synopsis: "In the last decade or so Britain has experienced renewed social and political panic over the consequences of excessive drinking, and the concept of 'alcohol related harms' has entered the language. A coherent policy community has developed, and research has multiplied, around questions of alcohol control. But governments have seemingly been reluctant to listen. \x0a\x0aMark Whitaker concludes his look at the politics of alcohol since the 17th century by examining New Labour's Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy of 2004, and related relaxation of the licensing system.\x0a\x0aWhitaker interviews the historians whose work has informed his own research, and asks them how they think the past can or should inform present policy. He talks to James Nicholls, Virginia Berridge, John Greenaway and Betsy Thom. They address questions about why the 'Drink Question' has been defined differently at different times; why the liquor industry has been so politically powerful; why the temperance movement lasted so long but seemingly achieved so little; and why alcoholism and drunkenness have posed distinct policy challenges. \x0a\x0aAbove all, they reflect on the complexity of alcohol as a commodity, and on why legislating about it has been, and remains, remarkably difficult.\x0a\x0aProducer: Mark Whitaker\x0aA Square Dog production for BBC Radio 4."

With a plentiful supply of wool from the island's hardy Shetland sheep, knitting kept many families from starvation, and the craft is still economically important for Fair Isle. Yet with Shetland schools soon to drop knitting from the curriculum, can it survive for much longer? Will Shetland's children still learn to knit, and if they don't, will it really matter? Moira Hickey visits Fair Isle to look at the importance of knitting to the islanders, and to ask what the future holds for this traditional craft."

          long_synopsis: "It's estimated the so-called 'baby boomer' generation, born in the twenty years after the Second World War, have amassed half of all the UK's housing wealth worth over 3 trillion pounds. The generation who grew up being told they had 'never had it so good' stand accused of making sure their children won't be able to say the same for themselves. Today's young families face a vastly different economic outlook to that which faced their parents. Although the under 40s account for half the population, estimates are that they own only 15% of the UK's total financial assets. Financial guru Alvin Hall offers his unique brand of advice on what people need to do for themselves and their families in this more challenging economic context.\x0a\x0aOver the series, Alvin Hall will meet people from different generations, from young couples through to the over 75s. He'll explore the varying financial pressures placed on different age groups and reveal how each generation is linked to the other. From the baby-boomer father determined to help his children clear their student debts even at the expense of his own retirement, to the young couple who can't afford to buy a home because the inheritance they expected hasn't materialized - Alvin Hall exposes how generational loyalties can get in the way of financial common sense.\x0a\x0aThe series will explore the economic themes that will dominate the agenda in the coming years. How prepared are today's younger workers for the effects of a burgeoning ageing population on the economy and welfare system? How realistic are they about the prospects for their own retirement? What role will families have to play in this changing environment for personal finance? Alvin Hall helps four different generations plan for an uncertain future in this new series."

          long_synopsis: "David Pownall's play has strong resonance for today. In 1936, George Orwell embarked on a visit to Wigan, a typical coal-mining town in industrial Lancashire in order to write a book about the people, their experiences and their struggle to cope with the effects of the Depression. \x0a\x0aDetermined not to be dismissed as a dispassionate observer, he resolves to spend time living with and amongst the people. However, he brings with him his self-guilt, his obsession with the English class system, his fiercely-held preconceptions of the working-class and his remarkable cut-glass voice, of which he is all too painfully aware. The visit is both revealing and humorous. \x0a\x0aHe stays in an appalling doss-house above a tripe shop, tries to work down a pit, stays with a family, makes a pass at the wife, upsets the local Women's Institute and meets a priest escaping from fascism in Spain. Whilst most who meet him take him for who and what he is, for Orwell the experience develops into a journey of self-discovery. \x0a\x0aCast:\x0a\x0aOrwell .... Adrian Scarborough \x0aNeil ....

          long_synopsis: "Professor Robert Winston brings together his expertise and experience in science and medicine with his overriding passion for music, to explore the relationship between the music and the medical conditions of composers who suffered mental and physical illness. \x0a\x0aRachmaninoff's second Piano Concerto has become one of classical music's most enduring hits, but it was almost never composed at all. The composer suffered an extreme creative block following the catastrophic premiere of his first symphony. After three years of silence, a hypnotherapist, Dr. Dahl, effected a cure and rescued his career. Prof. Winston also investigates evidence that a medical condition was responsible for Rachmaninoff's famously large hand-span, with pianist Peter Donohoe demonstrating the difficulty this presents for would-be performers of his music.\x0a\x0aProducer: Chris Taylor."

Back in the 1950's, Errol Flynn's house band were The Jolly Boys, the prime exponents of mento and 60 years later they're still playing together. Jon Baker, music producer and founder of Geejam records in Port Antonio rediscovered them and has modernised mento, got them back on the road and is bringing their distinctive style to a worldwide audience with their album Great Expectations. \x0a\x0aPresenter and architectural historian Dan Cruickshank has trawled through reels of treasured footage to unearth Britain's social history through film in BBC Two's The Great British Home Movie Roadshow. He's also been lurking around in the bushes for his documentary on the history of Britain's parks, part of BBC Four's The Call of the Wild season.\x0a\x0aChat show hosts from hell? Judge for yourself as Peter Curran tries to handle America's favourite fifty-something Jewish mothers Ronna & Beverly. Self help gurus who have already given unwanted advice to Matthew Perry, Russell Brand, Matt Lucas and David Baddiel back in Los Angeles, the cult phenoms bring their show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival throughout August.\x0a\x0aFrom LA to Las Vegas - 6Music's Gideon Coe talks to the self confessed god fearing, delusional and controversial stand up Brendon Burns about his book 'Fear of Hat Loss in Las Vegas' based on his extraordinary Nevada odyssey.\x0a\x0aMusic comes from Jamaica's Jolly Boys and London based singer-songwriter Jono McCleery.\x0a\x0aProducer: Cathie Mahoney."

          long_synopsis: "Julian Assange is the controversial editor-in-chief and public face of Wikileaks, the website that publishes sensitive documents, whilst protecting their sources. It's dominated this week's headlines following the release online of over 90,000 secret military reports from Afghanistan, and is accused of having blood on its hands. The documents give insights into military operations, and reveal there have been more civilian casualties than previously acknowledged. Some material also reveals the names of Afghan informers, and Assange is being held responsible for putting people's lives at risk and endangering national security. \x0a\x0aAn Australian, Julian Assange first gained notoriety in the 1990s when he was charged with dozens of computer hacking offences. Little is known about his upbringing, but his parents ran a puppet theatre and he's believed to have moved school dozens of times. The organisation he founded in 2006 has no headquarters, no offices and little formal structure. Assange again leads a nomadic lifestyle moving around Europe, saying he fears arrest if he returns to America - in April, the website released graphic, classified footage of an American helicopter gunship killing Iraqis in a Baghdad, and had previously revealed a classified US manual from Guantanamo Bay. \x0a\x0aAdmired by some for protecting whistle-blowers and puncturing state secrecy, Assange has been attacked by others for an irresponsible attitude, driven by ideology and prepared to accept 'collateral damage'. \x0a\x0aWith insights from friends, colleagues and critics, Nigel Thompson profiles the man behind Wikileaks."

          long_synopsis: "As the last blast furnace on Teesside is mothballed, Felicity Finch - who plays Ruth in The Archers - returns to her home town of Redcar to mark the end of 170 years of steelmaking in the area. Iron and Steel from Teesside helped build the world - the name is stamped on structures from the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Canary Wharf. At one time there were more than a hundred blast furnaces lining the River Tees from Stockton to Redcar. \x0aNow, with the decommissioning of Redcar's Corus plant, it means the end of an industry which defined the region and defined it's people. It also means a bleak future for jobs on Teesside.\x0aIt was the discovery of huge deposits of iron ore under the Cleveland Hills in the 1840's which prompted a mini-Klondyke and brought migrant workers from across the country and the continent to dig for \"rusty gold\". Communities sprang up virtually over-night and Middlesbrough became known as \"Ironopolis\" , and was christened by Gladstone, \"An Infant Hercules\". \x0aThe deposits of iron ore ran out in the middle of the tewntieth century - but by then, the steel making industry was well established. The last of the Cleveland iron miners were recorded for posterity 20 years ago by a local film maker, Craig Hornby, who was curious to know more about his own history and heritage. The men - then in their 80's and 90's - told stories of life underground in an industry which had been over-shadowed by coal mining. Hornby was determined that their story should be heard - and released a film - about their lives and the way they'd helped build Teesside, which played to packed houses across the region. Archive of the old iron miners from Hornby's film \"A Century in Stone\" is included in the programme.\x0aFelicity Finch - who spent her childhood years in Redcar - revisits the region to see how much it's changed ; she climbs Eston Nab with Craig Hornby, visits the iron-rush settlement of California - named after the US gold rush city - and goes underground to see the old iron workings; she hears from workers at Corus who started - and finished - their careers at the Redcar blast furnace; and discovers how much identity is tied up with heavy industry in Teesside - a region often overshadowed by it's more assertive neighbours , Yorkshire to the south Durham and Newcastle to the north."

          long_synopsis: "Roger McGough presents a mixture of poetry requests, including verse by Simon Armitage, Denise Levertov and John Keats.  The readers are Kenneth Cranham, Annette Badland and Jonjo O'Neill.   Elegies for lost lovers and dead trees ring out, with a quirky poem by the American Louis Untermeyer 'To a Telegraph Pole' and a poem about Orpheus, whose music made the trees dance.  Sue Hubbard reads her poem about his long suffering subterranean wife, Eurydice.  The seams of poetry and music are interlaced in Patrick Kavanagh's famous 'On Raglan Road', and we find out what ails the 'knight at arms, alone and palely loitering' in John Keats's 'La Belle Dames Sans Merci.' A half hour bound to hath thee in thrall.\x0aProducer:   Sarah Langan."

          medium_synopsis: "Nigel Thompson profiles Julian Assange, the controversial frontman of the website WikiLeaks, now accused of having blood on its hands after publishing Afghan military reports."
          long_synopsis: "Julian Assange is the controversial editor-in-chief and public face of Wikileaks, the website that publishes sensitive documents, whilst protecting their sources. It's dominated this week's headlines following the release online of over 90,000 secret military reports from Afghanistan, and is accused of having blood on its hands. The documents give insights into military operations, and reveal there have been more civilian casualties than previously acknowledged. Some material also reveals the names of Afghan informers, and Assange is being held responsible for putting people's lives at risk and endangering national security. \x0a\x0aAn Australian, Julian Assange first gained notoriety in the 1990s when he was charged with dozens of computer hacking offences. Little is known about his upbringing, but his parents ran a puppet theatre and he's believed to have moved school dozens of times. The organisation he founded in 2006 has no headquarters, no offices and little formal structure. Assange again leads a nomadic lifestyle moving around Europe, saying he fears arrest if he returns to America - in April, the website released graphic, classified footage of an American helicopter gunship killing Iraqis in a Baghdad, and had previously revealed a classified US manual from Guantanamo Bay. \x0a\x0aAdmired by some for protecting whistle-blowers and puncturing state secrecy, Assange has been attacked by others for an irresponsible attitude, driven by ideology and prepared to accept 'collateral damage'. \x0a\x0aWith insights from friends, colleagues and critics, Nigel Thompson profiles the man behind Wikileaks."

Rahman won two Oscars for the film score of Slumdog Millionaire it shot him to international recognition. \x0a\x0aBut the man dubbed 'The Mozart of Madras' had been a phenomenally successful composer long before that. He has been a massive celebrity in India for the past 20 years, yet remains a shy and modest man who attributes his success to his Sufi faith.\x0a\x0aPresenter Navid Akhtar meets A.R.Rahman and explores the role that spirituality and technology have played in his long career.\x0a\x0aStill only in his early 40s, Rahman has produced chart-topping music for over 500 movies, countless catchy advertising jingles and even a West End musical Bombay Dreams, whose producer Andrew Lloyd Webber describes him as the 'most talented melodist of our time'. \x0a\x0aNow he's being increasingly sought out by international film directors.\x0a\x0aSince his spectacular debut as a film composer on Roja in 1992 (chosen as one of the ten top soundtracks ever by Time magazine), A.R. Rahman's prolific output has transformed and reinvigorated Indian film music, effortlessly introducing fusion elements from all over the world. \x0a\x0aHe has become the highest-earning music composer in India. The soundtracks are launched ahead of the films and become instant dance hits. Often his soundtracks have become chart-toppers even when the films flopped, selling out within hours of their release. \x0a\x0aIn the week that he completes an ambitious world tour at Wembley Arena, we discover what lies behind his success.\x0a\x0aProducer: Mukti Jain Campion\x0aA Culturewise production for BBC Radio 4."

He went there reluctantly, unconvinced as to what so small a group of islands could offer him. He describes it as \"the best decision I never made\". What he found there was a place full of beauty, isolation and a unique community. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of over two hundred small islands, only five of them inhabited. It was on the smallest of these populated isles, Bryher, that Michael stayed that first time, and which he visits many times a year and upon which many of the stories are based. \x0a\x0aHe unpicks why the islands have been such a source of magic and inspiration for him. He speaks to Scillonians to hear firsthand old stories and to uncover new ones he's never heard before, revealing how historical fact and handed-down fiction can often be blurred.\x0a\x0aThroughout the programme there are readings from Michael's books inspired by these islands.\x0a\x0aProducer: Susie Matthews\x0aA Unique production for BBC Radio 4."

          long_synopsis: "Julian Assange is the controversial editor-in-chief and public face of Wikileaks, the website that publishes sensitive documents, whilst protecting their sources. It's dominated this week's headlines following the release online of over 90,000 secret military reports from Afghanistan, and is accused of having blood on its hands. The documents give insights into military operations, and reveal there have been more civilian casualties than previously acknowledged. Some material also reveals the names of Afghan informers, and Assange is being held responsible for putting people's lives at risk and endangering national security. \x0a\x0aAn Australian, Julian Assange first gained notoriety in the 1990s when he was charged with dozens of computer hacking offences. Little is known about his upbringing, but his parents ran a puppet theatre and he's believed to have moved school dozens of times. The organisation he founded in 2006 has no headquarters, no offices and little formal structure. Assange again leads a nomadic lifestyle moving around Europe, saying he fears arrest if he returns to America - in April, the website released graphic, classified footage of an American helicopter gunship killing Iraqis in a Baghdad, and had previously revealed a classified US manual from Guantanamo Bay. \x0a\x0aAdmired by some for protecting whistle-blowers and puncturing state secrecy, Assange has been attacked by others for an irresponsible attitude, driven by ideology and prepared to accept 'collateral damage'. \x0a\x0aWith insights from friends, colleagues and critics, Nigel Thompson profiles the man behind Wikileaks."

          long_synopsis: "Colonel \"Elephant Bill\" Williams' amazing story of how, in the summer of 1957, the largest elephant in captivity - Big Charlie - was moved from Butlin's Holiday Camp in Ayr, Scotland, to Butlin's, Filey, Yorkshire. \x0a\x0aIn May 1957, an advertisement in The Times caught Elephant Bill's eye. Butlin's Ltd was offering £1,000 in cash for the immediate safe transport of the largest elephant in captivity from its camp in Ayr to its camp in Filey - a distance by road of 350 miles.\x0a\x0aColonel JH Williams had earned his sobriquet \"Elephant Bill\" as a result of his experiences working with elephants in the jungles of Burma and, intrigued by the advertisement, he volunteered his services. As did 3,500 other people, for the problem of moving Big Charlie, a 5 and a half ton male elephant, and one of the finest tuskers in captivity, had captured the popular imagination.\x0a\x0aSome of the suggestions for moving the elephant were eccentric in the extreme, but not long after the advertisement appeared, Elephant Bill found himself engaged as elephant consultant - with very ill-defined duties - to help Mr Willie Wilson of Glasgow transport Big Charlie. \x0a\x0aAlthough Big Charlie was accompanied at all times on the journey by his gentle and devoted mahout, Shaik Ibrahim, the job was made much more hazardous by the fact that Big Charlie was on \"musth\" - or in season - and that Billy Butlin's demands for constant publicity posed tricky problems for all concerned.\x0a\x0aThe story of this incredible journey begins today.\x0a\x0aWritten by J.H.Williams. Abridged and read by Tony Lidington.\x0a\x0aProducer: David Blount\x0aA Pier production for BBC Radio 4."

Vince Cable, the Secretary of State with responsibility for Universities has warned that if that does happen - there'll be no Government bail-out. Meanwhile as the cuts bite, courses are being scrapped and jobs are being axed. The University of Cumbria has seen one third of the Board of Governors step down after a report into their effectiveness described them as naive after presiding over an unsustainable annual deficit. At Leeds Metropolitan University a former Vice Chancellor pursued a 'low-charging, high impact' policy offering cut price courses and pouring over £20m into partnership deals with local sports teams. Critics say the policy left it with a deficit approaching £7-million.\x0a\x0aProfessor Simon Lee the former Vice Chancellor emphatically rejects these criticisms and told us that:\x0a- The decisions made whilst he was Vice Chancellor were done with the full support of the Board of Governors and senior managment team \x0a- The 51% share in Leeds Rugby Club bought by the university offered students the opportunity to study there during the day then watch games at night as well as take part in community projects \x0a- The contribution of £14m to the building of the new Headlingley Carnegie Cricket Pavilion offered first class opportunities to students to study and work there\x0a- By offering lower fees than other universities in England applications to Leeds increased dramatically."
